Mr_Hero's Canvas Creator (Magic Card Creator)
Build images using inputs generated by simple JSON Templates
I origannly designed this to be used for making Magic Proxy Cards but it could really be used for anything

## How Does It Work?

People build templates using Easy to Read JSON which describes image/text layers and input fields that provide data for those layers.
Users load a template which presents them with the inputs described in it
An image is then generated by processing the inputs and the layers on a HTML5 Canvas

## How do I create a template?

Refer to the Wiki to see available fields of the template file

## Contributing

Feel free to make a Pull Request to the Development Branch
I'm really not good at the whole "Making stuff look good" thing so I'd really appreciate some PRs to fix that
